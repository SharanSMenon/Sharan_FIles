   <p style="width:60%;overflow:auto;">Three important character traits of Ben Carson’s “TB” is knowledge, time, and honesty. All ten of the “TB” topics are important but these three topics are the most important. With knowledge, time, and honesty, one can live a good life. When a person is honest he tries to hold “uprightness of character and conduct truthfulness” (Macmillan 493). He will not tell a lie and his life becomes simple. If a person has knowledge, he will be able to achieve many things. Knowledge is “information is knowledge acquired through observation, study, and experience” (Macmillan 569). God is important because he affected Ben Carson’s life and other people’s life in so many ways. Without God, Ben Carson and other people would not be where they are right now. God is “a superhuman being who is worshipped” (Scholastic Children’s Dictionary 280) The three topics lead a person to a path of success. Honesty, knowledge, and time are the roots of Ben Carson’s “TB”.
The first incident that happened with Ben Carson is to do with God. This incident happened in Yale University. He was doing bad in his classes because the method he used for high school by studying at the last minute, but he realized that the method would not work at Yale, so he was slipping behind in his classes, especially in chemistry. It was the end of the first semester so he had final examinations. In his book, he wrote “Sunlight and shadows danced on the ivy walls but the beauty of that autumn day mocked me” (Carson 71). He prayed to God to help him on the test as he was walking around the campus. At his room, he studied till ten o clock and studied for two more hours till he fell asleep. In his dream, a nebulous figure appeared and started writing chemistry problems and worked them out. Ben Carson took notes of everything that the figure wrote. When he woke up, he hurried down to the chemistry lecture hall with a feeling of resignation. There were about one thousand students in the lecture hall. The professor handed the test and it took him a while to hand out the test because there were a lot of students. As he was doing the test, all the problems on the test were the same as the ones that the shadowy figure in his dream. He walked around the campus trying to figure out what happened. He realized that God pulled a miracle for Ben Carson.
The second incident that happened with Ben Carson is to do with honesty. This incident happened in Yale University. He and his colleagues had to retake a final exam for his psychology course: Perceptions 301. The professor had inadvertently burned the other final exam papers so they had to retake the test. He went into the auditorium with 150 other students that were also in the course. There was a notice on the test paper saying students cannot leave the auditorium until the test is done. The test was complex and Ben Carson said “they were so intricate that I figured that a brilliant psychiatrist might have trouble with some of them” (Carson 86). Students started leaving the auditorium one by one. If the professor asked them why they left, they decided that they would lie and tell that they did not read the notice. The students kept on leaving till Ben Carson was the only student left. When it was only Ben Carson, the professor flung the door open and came in with the photographer for the Yale newspaper. The professor told Ben Carson that the test was a hoax to see who was the most honest and that was Ben Carson. He got to be on the Yale newspaper. The professor did something better to Ben Carson, the professor handed a ten-dollar bill to Ben Carson. In “Think Big” for honesty, Ben Carson said: “When you do something dishonest, you must do something else dishonest to cover it up and your life becomes hopelessly complex. The same with telling lies. If you are honest, you do not have to remember what you said earlier. Speaking the truth makes life amazingly simple.” (Carson 217). He is saying that honesty makes life very simple. Being honest is a very important character trait to Ben Carson and it is also an important “Think Big” character trait.
The third and final that happened with Ben Carson is to do with knowledge. This incident happened in the University of Michigan and his friend’s workshop when he was a radiology technician. For one of his monthly rotations, he had to locate the Foramen Ovale using this technique that consumes a lot of time. He wanted to find an easier way to locate the Foramen Ovale and he was arguing with himself. Ben Carson suddenly remembered his friends that he made the previous summer. He had a summer job there as a radiology technician. He went there and explained what was his problem. His friends allowed him to practice with the equipment that was there. After several days, Ben Carson found a technique that saved doctors lot of time. He placed one metal ring at the back of the area where the Foramen Ovale should be. He placed another ring in the front of the skull. By passing an x-ray through the skull, the doctor would turn the head till rings line up. At that point, the Foramen Ovale falls in between. That was his technique for locating the Foramen Ovale. In Ben Carson’s “TB” he wrote for knowledge: “Knowledge is the key for independent living, the key to all your dreams, hopes, and aspirations. If you are knowledgeable, particularly more knowledgeable than others in that field, you become invaluable and write your own ticket.” (Carson 218). He is saying that if you have more knowledge, you should not doubt your own talent. Knowledge is at the very roots of Ben Carson’s “TB”.
Knowledge is a crucial topic in Ben Carson’s “THINK BIG” and in normal life. Without knowledge, one cannot pursue many of his dreams. Knowledge must be acquired first before anybody can use it. Ben Carson acquired knowledge through books and other learning tools. With knowledge, one can do anything they want/need and pursue their dreams. Knowledge has helped Ben Carson in many places and situations. When Ben Carson was in fifth grade, he was teased because he always received bad grades. After he started pursuing knowledge by using books, he became the top of the class which earned him a good social status because many students were dependent on him, making him popular. It helped his social life. It was knowledge that enabled him to go to Yale University which helped him pursue his dreams of being a doctor. He could develop a new method to locate the foramen ovale which was less time consuming and less energy was wasted. Dr. Carson performed many surgeries that were rendered impossible by other neurosurgeons because he was confident of the knowledge he has on surgeries. Ben Carson has been successful because he used his knowledge when needed and other times too. In his family life, knowledge (experience too) has enabled him to make the wise decision of spending more time with his family. Knowledge is a crucial character trait to Ben Carson and many other people.
Knowledge has played a big part in my life. I use knowledge to do almost everything from typing this essay to baking a cookie. It is mostly knowledge that made me what I am today. Knowledge is what enabled me to enjoy life the way it is. It also makes me realize how lucky I am to be on this earth and to be a part of an amazing civilization. Knowledge has affected my life in countless ways. I use knowledge in taking tests, building things, and many other activities. This is the quality that changed me the most. This quality will be useful in my future in various ways. When I grow up and go for a job, I must use knowledge efficiently for my career growth and the growth of the company. Without knowledge, I would not be successful in my life. whatever I do anywhere. In conclusion, knowledge is the most important character in my life and in Ben Carson’s “Think Big”.
Stacey Logan is a twelve-year-old black boy who is in seventh grade. He has two brothers and one sister. Their family owns 400 acres of land. Stacey is a very good example of kindness. The definition of kindness is “The quality of being friendly, generous and considerate” (Oxford Dictionaries website) He knows what he needs to do when someone is in trouble and he does not stand idle. There are three incidents that portray his kindness. The first incident occurred when he comforted his brother, Little Man who was sad and angry. The second incident was when Stacey helped TJ, one of his friends, get home because he could not make it there by himself, as he was injured badly. After that, a series of events that Stacey does to help prevent TJ from being hanged by night men, is the summary of the third incident of his kindness. 

	The Logan children and other black kids, had to walk a long way to school as they are not given the facility of travelling on a bus. When the Logan children walk to school, they also encounter the harassment of Jefferson Davis School Bus (Bus in which the white children travel) which always gets them dirty. Little Man likes to keep his clothes clean. One day when they were walking to school, the Bus passed by very close to them and they had to jump across the gully to escape from being runover by the bus. All four of them did not make it to the other side of the gully and their cloths got dirty. However, this made Little Man very angry. He takes a mudball and throws it at the Bus. While he is doing that, the kids on the bus tease him which made him angrier. He misses the bus a few feet short and he starts crying. Stacey comes to comfort him and promised him that they will get revenge. He said “Come on, Man. It is not gonna happen no more, least not for a long while. I promise you that” (Logan 49). He also prevented TJ from saying anything mean to them. They planned on a revenge to make Little Man happy. Stacey loved his brother and he did not like the kind of treatment that was happening to him. Instead of acting furiously when the incident occurred, he consoled his brother and prevented his friend TJ from saying mean words and waited for the right time to act upon his plans.

	TJ wanted a pearl-handled pistol that was in Jim Lee Barnett’s store. RW and Melvin Simms promised him that they would get him anything that he wanted. One night they broke into Jim Lee’s store and they took the pistol and gave that to TJ and they took the money box. Mr. Barnett, who also eventually lives in the store, tried to get the money box from Melvin but RW hit Mr. Barnett on the back of his head with an axe. RW and Melvin were wearing black masks so the Barnett’s thought that all three of them were black. After they got out, TJ said that he will tell everybody that RW and Melvin did this. They beat him up and threw him on the road. He managed to get to the Logan’s house where he told Stacey and Cassie the story. He showed them his stomach and he coughed blood. Stacey did say “He’s hurt bad, Cassie. I got to get him home.” (Logan 249). Stacey said that he will go alone but Cassie said that she will also go because she wanted to make sure that Stacey will come back in one piece. Eventually, all four of them went together and dropped TJ at his home. This is an example where he shows his kindness by helping his friend who came asking for his help.
	After getting TJ back to his home when Stacey and his siblings were just about to leave, a bunch of headlights appeared at the Avery’s house. They were the night men, who are white men that acts badly against black people. They wanted TJ because they thought that TJ was responsible for what happened to Mr. Barnett. The night men threw the Avery’s out of their house and dragged TJ on his knees. Mr. and Ms. Avery were helpless and as night men were about to hang TJ. Stacey tells Cassie to get their Papa(Father) and Cassie tells the whole story to him. Stacey said “W-we got to get help” (Logan 250). Their Papa helps to prevent TJ from being hanged by starting a fire, which causes the night men to get away from TJ and stop the fire. Eventually, Sheriff takes away TJ and puts him into jail. This incident where Stacey stays behind until his friend is saved shows the example of third act of kindness.

Stacey is a kid that has common sense and he will not do foolish things. If there is a foolish thing that he can prevent or stop, he will stop it or he will at least attempt. When the Night men threw Claude (TJ’s brother) out, Christopher-John (Stacey’s first brother) tried to get up and stop the night men, but Stacey stopped him from doing that. If Stacey was not there, Christopher-John and probably the others would have gotten into big trouble. He also knows how to react to the situation that he is involved in. When TJ got dragged out of his house, he reacted to the situation by cleverly by asking Cassie to go get Papa, instead of fighting against the night men. After Stacey got whipped by his mom because she thought that Stacey was cheating on his history test. and Cassie was asking Little Willie everything. Cassie said “Stacey would never do anything like that.” (Logan 81). She knew that Stacey was truthful and would never cheat on anything. In short, Stacey was very helpful to his friends and family and would standup to help them in every possible way.
This article is about evolution, which is the answer to the question “Where did we come from?”. Here is the diagram of human evolution.

Fact: Charles Darwin did not develop the Evolution theory, other people already had that idea like his     grandfather, Erasmus Darwin. He was a naturalist like Charles Darwin.

This picture above shows that we came from MONKEYS. As new monkeys were born, changes in the monkeys came (Also known as mutations). these changes either were helpful or harmful. when the next generation came, the helpful changes were passed on, while the harmful changes were thrown out because the creatures with the harmful gene were probably not able to reproduce. this process is called natural selection. It is when nature selects the traits to preserve or throw out as generations pass by. For us humans, we got our intelligence as our main advantage.

There is also a process called artificial selection where man chooses who to breed and who to not breed. Dogs came from artificial selection. They were bred by man to help in hunting, guarding, and many other things. Men tamed wild wolves and bred them.

Evolution is also slow. Here is an example of the slowness of evolution. When you get frightened you get goosebumps (it is when the hair on your body rises). You get it because you are trying to scare the enemy by trying looking bigger and scarier. But your body has not gotten the message that the enemy can barely see your body hair.

Mutations are the changes that happen when a baby is born. You have had many mutations, otherwise you would look exactly like your parents. there is also changes in your fingerprints. No 2 people have the fingerprints, so police use fingerprints to catch criminal. Your fingerprints also change. It was a mutation in one bear that made the polar bears. the bear was born with white fur instead of brown fur. The white fur gave the bear an advantage because it could camouflage well and catch prey easier. So, through the process of natural selection, the white fur became more common in bears in later generations and less brown bears. Eventually white bears evolved into a species known as the polar bear.
		                        Genetics

All this evolution happens with genetics. Genetics are about genes. It is a very important part of evolution. You have a complex molecule called DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid). It is shaped like a double helix (it looks like a twisted ladder). There are 4 bases in DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine.
These are the nitrogenous bases. It is an organic molecule. Back to the bases. Adenine only bonds with thymine and cytosine only bonds with guanine and vice versa. You can use the bases as many times as you want. That makes a gene. A gene is a section of your DNA. One gene might decide your Skin color and another gene might decide your Eye color. Chromosomes are a bunch of organized DNA. You have 46 chromosomes. 23 from your mom and 23 from your dad. It is like all your information is stored in 46 books. The 23rd pair decides your sex; male or female. The mother gives a X chromosome. The chromosome that comes from your father decides your sex. If it is a Y chromosome, you are a boy. If it a X chromosome, you are a girl. SO, XY for boy and XX for girl. We will talk more about Genetics in the reproduction section. Let us say that a baby is born with brown eyes and his mom has blue eyes and his dad has brown eyes. 2 genes are coding for the same trait. How can that be and what do they do? They do not make 1 eye brown and the other blue. There are recessive and dominant genes. Obviously, the dominant gene is dominant and in the eye case, brown usually wins so the baby is born with brown eyes.

                              Life cycle of a cell
This section is on the life cycle of a cell. The type of cell we are going to talking about is eukaryotic cells (animal cells). This is also another important part of evolution. It is where mutations occur. Here is the life cycle of a cell. It spends 90% of its life in interphase. They do not divide in this stage. That is for another stage. The process of DNA replication happens in the Nucleus, where all the genetic information. This is also where they replicate DNA and where mutations occur. Here are the 4 main proteins in DNA replication: Helicase, DNA polymerase, primase, and ligase (also enzymes). First, the protein helicase (also known as the unzipping enzymes), splits apart the DNA. So, it is now two strands of unpaired bases. Than DNA polymerase gives the unpaired bases a partner (the base that it will join with). Primase tells the DNA polymerase where to go. Primase is made of a primer and that primer is made of up RNA (Ribonucleic acid). Ligase (also known as “the gluer”) glues the DNA fragments together. DNA replication starts a place called the origin. There can be multiple origins in the DNA. I am going to write down the steps again but in more detail this time. Helicase unwinds DNA at the point of origin. SSB (single stranded binding proteins) binds to the DNA strands keeping them separated. Primase creates primer and makes a trail to guide the DNA polymerase. The DNA polymerase begins to add the bases to the two strands as it follows the trail of primer that primase created. They are not identical so that is where the mutations happen. The DNA also do not line up with each other. One strand goes from 3’ to 5’ and the other goes from 5’ to 3’. The 5’ and 3’ has to do with the sugars that make up the “backbone” of the DNA. The 3’ and 5’ means 3 prime and 5 prime. The DNA are also antiparallel. The strand that runs from 5’ to 3’ is the leading strand. The strand that runs from 3’ to 5’ is the lagging strand. It turns out that the DNA polymerase can only work in the 5’ to 3’ direction. What do they do? The primase creates more primer and that primer goes in the opposite direction so the DNA polymerase still works in the 5’ to 3’ direction. On the lagging strand, you tend to get a lot of fragments called the Okazaki fragments. It was named after Reiji Okazaki (1930-1975) who was a molecular biologist. Ligase takes care of the gaps in the lagging strand. DNA polymerase proofs the new strands of DNA to see any errors and correct them. But it might also miss a few errors and that is where the mutations happen. Now onto mitosis. That is where the cell divides. After it has completed all its work, it is ready to divide. There are 4 phases in mitosis: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. After mitosis, cytokinesis happens. Cytokinesis is where the cytoplasm splits, completing the cell division.
                            Reproduction
We are now talking about the egg and sperm. The egg is in the female body and the sperm comes from the male body to the female body by some stuff that I don’t want to talk about. The egg and sperm contains 23 chromosomes (not 23 pairs). So, when you combine them, you get 46 chromosomes (23 pairs); the full set. The sperm contains genetic information from the dad. The egg contains genetic information from the mom. When they combine due to some stuff I currently do not want to talk about, the egg becomes a zygote. A zygote is a fertilized egg because it combined with the sperm. The egg begins its first division after 24 hours. Then it keeps on splitting and eventually becomes an embryo. It keeps on splitting till it has all the cells it needs to be a body. After being in the womb for 9 months since the first division, it is ready to come out. Obviously, the baby is different from its parents and it possibly could have some defects. Let us say that this baby has no defects.


Wart learns about bravery, order/discipline from his encounter with the hawks in Hob’s mews. Wart goes to Merlyn’s tower and says, “I think I ought to have some more education” (Sins 96). Merlyn agrees and asks him what animal he wants to be. Wart said that he would be a merlin hawk in Hob’s mews. Merlyn warns not to go near Cully for that he is very dangerous. So, Merlyn turns wart into a hawk and sends him into the mews. Wart introduces himself there and he also answers a 10-question quiz. He gets 9 out of 10 questions correct. Next, they send him to stand next to Colonel Cully. Wart does protest but then he realizes that he would have to tell the truth so he goes there despite Merlyn’s warning. After he succeeds in his ordeal, they sing the triumph song. He wakes up in his bed the next morning.
Warts about bravery and order/discipline. He was brave during his ordeal with Colonel Cully. He was warned by Merlyn not to go near Cully but Wart was forced to stand in order to conceal his identity. He learns about order/discipline from the peregrine. She commands all the hawks. He also must use his knowledge to answer the question. That shows the value of education a bit. That is what Wart learned from this experience.
Magic/Merlyn Moment #2
	Wart finds out that history is an important thing to learn about during a conversation with a grass snake. One fine day, Wart and Merlyn were walking through the woods when Merlyn caught a male-grass snake. Wart got really scared when he saw the snake. Merlyn told wart to calm down because this snake cannot do any harm to a person. Everyone kills them because they have a V on their head. They think that it is a viper. Merlyn lets the snake go and it goes into a bed of nettles. Wart asks Merlyn to turn him into a snake. Merlyn turns Wart into a grass snake and tells him to find the other snake. Wart finds the other snake but it was still really scared. It inquired about Merlyn before calming down. After the other snake calms down, they start talking. The snake asks him, “Do you have a mother?” (Sins 154). This snake turned out to be a kind snake. The name of the snake was T. Natrix. The snake thought that he did not know history or legends because he did not have a mother so T. Natrix. asks Wart if he wants to know history or legends. Wart tells T. Natrix. that he wants to learn history. T. Natrix. tells about the origins about man and about the last Atlantasaurus. The Atlantasaurus defeated the Ceratasaurus after a lengthy battle. Saint George comes and kills the Atlantasaurus and T. Natrix. gets sad because they were of the same race. Wart asks T. Natrix to tell some legends because he did not want the snake to be sad. T. Natrix tells him about the story of how the poisonous snakes got their poison and why the python is not poisonous. T. Natrix sleeps for his afternoon nap and Wart too. Merlyn had to wake Wart up.
	Wart learns about the value of history and he listens to a legend. He learns about the origins of man and he learns about the last Atlantasaurus. He also listens to another person’s opinion about Saint George. People consider Saint George a hero because he slayed the dragon but T. Natrix thinks that he is evil because he slayed a reptile of T. Natrix’s race. That is what Wart learns in his encounter with T. Natrix.
Magic/Merlyn Moment #3
	Wart learns the value of education from his encounter with a badger. Merlyn decides to finish Wart’s education and he tells wart that this is the last time that he can turn wart into something. So, Merlyn turns wart into a badger. Wart sees a hedgehog sleeping and says that he will eat him up. The hedgehog sings songs and wart asks where he learned those songs and the hedgehog says that he was Merlyn’s pet so wart does not eat him. Wart goes to badger’s house. Badger says, “Merlyn sent you to me”, the badger said, “To finish off your education” (Sins 234). The badger says that the true end of philosophy is to dig and to love your home. Badger told wart that he is writing a treatise to point out why Man is the master of all the animals. Badger said that all the embryos looked the same when they came out. They could change 3 body parts for something else. Man said that he will stay the way that he is so God made Man the master of all animals. Wart turned back into a human the next day.
	Wart learns the value of education. He also learns why Man is the master of all animals. He learns that Man was supposed to be a fair king, he should not kill a animal because he wanted to. He should only kill an animal if it was needed. In short, killing animals was not a sport, it was injustice to the animals. He also learns why all the animals look the way that they look. They traded their parts for whatever they have. That is what Wart learns in his encounter with badger.
  Three of the most important weapons in Medieval Warfare were Swords, Spears, and Catapults. These weapons were important before guns came along. Swords were used for fights and face-to-face combat. Spears could be thrown from far away. People use spears to reach an enemy from far away. They also use it for hunts. Spears were one of the oldest weapons known to humanity. Catapults are used as siege weapons. They can break down castle walls allowing an army to break into an enemy’s castle. All three of the weapons would have made a person erally powerful. It also depends on the quality of the item. If it is good, then they will be powerful and if the quality is badSwords, catapults, and spears were probably the most important weapons before the invention of the gun.

Swords were probably the most important weapon before guns. They have a long and sharp blade attached onto a handle. The blade is the part that does the attacking and the handle is made so that the person can hold it without harming himself/herself. Swords are used for face-to-face combat. They are also used for self-defense/ to defend others. If someone breaks into a person’s house, they can take a sword (If there is no guns) to defend himself/herself or there might be guards stationed outside of a castle. Those guards are probably armed with swords/spears. They might use the sword to attack the intruder and protect the castle Swords were also prized possessions. People might get a sword if they win a competition. There are also swords that are said to be legendary/priceless in myths. One example of those types of swords is Excalibur which is King Arthur’s sword. King Arthur was the king of England. He was probably the most famous king nut he is probably a myth. King Arthur was the king that was destined to get that sword so he had Excalibur. It is said that he received it from the Lady of the Lake. He also had a sword that Merlyn created to find the true king of England. Swords were very important weapons in medieval times.

Spears are one of the oldest weapons known to humanity. A spear consists of a long pole or shaft with a sharply pointed head. Warriors used to carry 2 types of spears with them. One is light so that they can throw it and the other one is heavier because it is used for stabbing. Warriors even carried spears that were over twenty feet long so that they can stab from a safe distance. Spears were used by early humans to hunt mammoths/other animals during the Ice Age. In the Middle Ages, spears were also used for hunting. They used spears to hunt animals like boars and many other animals. They were also used to protect. If a person went in a journey, they might use a spear to protect themselves. They were also, used in medieval warfare to attack the enemy from long distances. Spears were also used in jousting. Jousting was a competition where 2 knights had to knock each other off their horse. Kings saw that many of their best knights were being killed in jousts so some kings banned jousts. Other people started using blunted versions of spears so that less or no harm is done. Spears can also be used in face to face combat. Soldiers might use them to stab their opponent if they are close by. Spears were a very important weapon in the Middle Ages for battle before guns.

Catapults are siege weapons. It can also be used in normal warfare. It shot objects such as spears, rocks and many other items. The two main types of catapults are torsion and nontorsion. Nontorsion catapults were like giant bows and arrows. They shoot objects with stretched bands. Torsion catapults shoot objects by releasing a twisted rope which makes a beam to spring forward which threw the object. Nontorsion catapults were developed by the Greeks around 300 B.C. Torsion catapults were developed around 350 B.C. The Romans made it movable by mounting them on carriages around 100 A.D. They are still used for warfare today. They are now used to launch airplanes from the deck of aircraft carriers. Catapults were important back then and they are important now.

The most important weapons in medieval times were the sword, catapult and spear. Swords now are a prized possession. Spears are now artifacts. Catapults are used by militaries to launch airplanes off an aircraft carrier. Go back 1000 years from now, they would be very important weapons/tools. Spears were used for combat from long and short distances. Catapults were used as siege weapons. They were also used as a larger version of a bow and arrow/slingshot. Swords were used for face to face combat. They were also prized possessions. They were also used to show the wealth/power of people back then. Their glory days may be over but they have made their mark on the earth.
