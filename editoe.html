  <h1>Making of a friend</h1>
  <h3>By Jahnvi Sajiv Menon</h3>
  <p>Once upon a time, there were 3 little girls. They were best friends. They  had a flying bed, it was able to fit all three of them. But one day, their moms said that they were going to move to the country side and their enemy <i>Nesa</i> was coming because her parents were in Pennsylnvania for 8 days. The 3 girls started to pack and the next day, they left. They reached the  country side after an 8 hour journey. They ate supper and retired to their flying beds to sleep and one of them had to sleep with <i>Nesa</i> so they had to go on a flying journey with <i>Nesa</i>. Theirs moms kissed them goodnight and went to bed. Then the girls told <i>Nesa</i> about their flying adventures and <i>Nesa</i> replied <q>I don't want to come. I am going to sleep on the floor</q> in a really danvi-like voice. They commanded their beds to fly so their beds got their red, yellow, pink wings and they turned small to get out of the window and turned big when they got out again.Then they went above the clouds and they stated to fly somewhere. While the bed was flying, the 3 girls was just laying down on the bed. The bed started to dive so the girls held on for their lives. In the meanwhile, <i>Nesa</i> was wating for them to come back. Then the bed landed in an island. The girls looked down on the island and they saw a big fat tree and they tried to open the door but it wouldn't budge. The girls saw a <button>button</button> and they decided to press it. The <button>button</button> opened the door and they saw a big beautiful pathway. They stared at it for a minute and started to walk through. At last, they ended up in a <b>beautiful</b> forest. There are 3 trees with little necklaces. The 3 necklaces had a little amulet which were the colors of the beds. The girls knew that it was almost morning so they went to their beds and flew home. The next day, they eat breakfast, got ready and went out to explore the country side. While they were exploring, they found a mansion and and pretty little girl with red hair came out. She asked <q>Who are you guys and why were you knocking in my door?</q>. The girls replied <q>I am Molly, she is Christine, and she is Jennifer</q>. Molly asked <q>Who are you?</q>. The girl replied <q>My father is the mayor and I am Fiona</q>. Jennifer asked if they wanted to be friends and Fiona agreed. Fiona asked <q>Where is your home?</q>. Christine found a playground and all 4 of them went. They played for hours. Then it became suppertime so they went home and they said <q>I can't wait for my next adventure</q>.</p>

  <h1>Fiona to the rescue part 1</h1>
  <h3>By Jahnvi Sajiv Menon - changed by Sharan Sajiv Menon</h3>
  <p>One day, when the 3 girls were at Jennifer's house playing, they were make IMovies🎬 of each other (IMovie is a phone app which lets you edit movies). Jennifer and Christine were on their beds. Molly forgot bring her bed. Later, they started to play Video Games🎮. Then, it was evening time, so after their evening tea, Christine left because she had to get some supplies. There was still 4 more months of school and they had a big project due at the end the the school year. All three of them were working together on their project. Molly had supplies in her bed so she needed to get her bed so the left. Christine came back with a lot of supplies but Molly came back with a worried face😥, no supplies or bed. Christine and Jennifer asked what is the matter and Molly said that her bed was missing. Jennifer replied <q>It might be Nesa, she is leaving today and she is our enemy.</q>. When they brought this matter to their moms, the moms said that they can get a new bed for Molly. They decided to take Fiona as this will be her first adventure. It became night so they went to bed. Molly had to sleep on the floor. After a bit, they slowly got out of bed and got each other out and they went to Fiona's and went to her window. Then, they slowly called Fiona and when Fiona asked about Molly's bed. They said that Nesa took it and Nesa took it so they pleaded for Fiona's help to get Molly's bed. Fiona got her boat to cross this humongus river and they sailed on the boat and reached the city in 3 hours. They found Nesa's house and Nesa was sleeping on Molly's bed. Molly opened her watch and pressed a <button>button</button> and a non-flying replica on Molly's bed came and they put Nesa on the replica and took the real bed. Then they heard some footsteps and they knew that Nesa's mom was coming so the 4 girls jumped on Molly's bed and and tried to leave but got caught by Nesa's mom. The only girl that esacped was Fiona. The 3 girls tried to fight Nesa's mom but Nesa's mom was too powerful for them and trapped the 3 girls in a dungeon to rot for life. Fiona had a plan. Only if she could get the keys to the dungeon, she could free the girls. But she only had 24 hours to do it. If she failed the task, Nesa's mom would engage in a super dangerous battle with the other girls moms and that battle would kill everybody on the planet. </p>

Then you can create a new rectangle like this: <br> <code>var VariableName = new rectangle(height,width,background color)</code>. <br> Height and Width must be numbers and background color <br>must be put into quotes like this: <q cite="">background-color</q>. If you want to create a new <br> circle, then type: <code>var VariableName = new circle(height,width,background color)</code>. <br>Same rules apply for the circle.</p>
